		This website is the geoportfolio of Daniel Batagol. The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of geospatial science and surveying.
		<p>
		A brief introduction about myself is that I am born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and as of February 2024, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Science (Surveying) (Honours) course. I am interested in all aspects of surveying and I currently work for a land surveying company that 
		specialises in land development. Despite choosing surveying as a career, I am still interested in the world of geospatial science, as both go hand in hand. 
		My capstone project involves using GIS techniques to analyse the accessibility of sporting facilities for young people in Melbourne, a challenge for myself 
		to apply the GIS principles and techniques I have learnt during my course. 
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include travelling, cycling, running and reading!

		Cadastral Surveying Law covered the legal information regarding the cadastre of the land that a surveyor should know. The subject involved two 
		class tests, a practical component, and a major assessment component.

	<div class="bar"><h2>Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you have done yourself-->
	<div class="paragraphs">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a unique but very practical and interesting subject done in both geospatial science and surveying. The subject uses 
		knowledge from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		For the 2022 version of the course which I completed, the assignment was about the proposal of creating an amphitheatre at Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The topographic survey map was created using surveying data obtained on the field using a total station at Deep Rock Oval, Yarra Bend Park.
			As the class was completed during a time of Covid-19 induced lockdowns, the field practical was not able to be completed by the students and data from 
			previous years was used. The topographic map was made using LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD. The 3D generated scene was created using the ArcGIS suite program 
			ArcScene while the raw data was modified in ArcMap. The proposed pathway was created using ArcMap by using the GIS program to generate the pathway based 
			on slope angle and the amphitheatre based on z-values. The final map used Adobe Illustrator to create the map along with ArcMap for exporting the 2D 
			amphitheathre image and ArcScene for exporting the image of the 3D scene.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience within the surveying industry. The company I have worked at for over 3 years is
		Beveridge Williams. This page will cover the skills and knowledge I have learnt from my time working as an assistant at Beveridge 
		Williams.

		From my time working at Beveridge Williams, i learnt a lot about the surveying industry and the skillset required to be successful. 
		During my time I worked in the Estates team, which specialised in working on large greenfield estate subdivisions, which is subdividing
		farms into housing estates. I was able to land the job through a friend who was working there during 2021 and have enjoyed my time working 
		there since then.
		<p>
		As part of the Estates team, I helped with setting out title boundaries for inital and final pegs, feature surveys, control surveys, level runs, and title 
		boundary restablishment. These tasks were completed using Trimble S Series total stations, Trimble GPS recievers, and Leica Sprinter Digital Levels. 
		I have learnt how to set up a job and collect the information required to meet the clients needs and meet the accuracy and precision requirements. 
		I have even reached a point where I am able to head into the field on my own and complete the job using the knowledge i have learnt.
